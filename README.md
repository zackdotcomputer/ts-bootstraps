# Clean Webapp Bootstraps in Typescript

This is a curated collection of web starter bootstraps. They're all set up for you to use Typescript and every project comes with an eslint and prettier configuration for linting and styling the code.

They also come with recommended .vscode settings.

## Getting Started
